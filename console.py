"""This module defines the entry point of the command interpreter.

It defines one class, `HBNBCommand()`, which sub-classes the `cmd.Cmd` class.
This module defines abstractions that allows us to manipulate a powerful
storage system (FileStorage / DB). This abstraction will also allow us to
change the type of storage easily without updating all of our codebase.

It allows us to interactively and non-interactively:
    - create a data model
    - manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / interpreter
    - store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

Typical usage example:

    $ ./console
    (hbnb)

    (hbnb) help
    Documented commands (type help <topic>):
    ========================================
    EOF  create  help  quit

    (hbnb)
    (hbnb) quit
    $

    This class represents the command interpreter, and the control center

    It sub-classes Python's `cmd.Cmd` class which provides a simple framework
    for writing line-oriented command interpreters.
