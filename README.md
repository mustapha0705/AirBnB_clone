# AirBnB Clone

# Description of the project
The goal of the project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

# Decription of the command interpreter
It is a type of shell limited to a specific use case.
	-We start it by typing "./console.py" in our terminal or in non-interactive
	 mode by typing "echo 'command' | ./console.py", where "command" is an
	 allowed command.
	-Another way to use it is by starting it, and subsequently typing the command
	 in our terminal.

# Examples (to be added later on)
